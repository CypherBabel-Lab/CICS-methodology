# Introduction

Crypto Industry Classification Standard (CICS) is a classification standard focused on the crypto universe. CICS is a four-tiered, hierarchical industry classification system. It comprises 5 Sectors, 16 Industry Groups, 37 Industries, and 58 Sub-Industries.

The CICS methodology is considered a crypto industry analytical framework for industry research, investment analysis, portfolio management, and asset allocation. Companies are classified qualitatively due to the current lack of quantitative data in the crypto universe. As the crypto universe develops, quantitive data will become a critical factor for the classification methodology and be used accordingly. Each company or project is assigned a single CICS classification at the sub-industry level according to its principal business activity.&#x20;
