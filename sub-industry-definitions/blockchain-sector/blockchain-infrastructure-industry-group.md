# 1510 Blockchain Infrastructure (Crypto Category)

The Blockchain Infrastructure Crypto Category contains companies, organizations, and projects involved in smart contract protocols, computing, storage, network, and privacy.



## 151010 Smart Contract Protocols (Crypto Sub-category)

The Smart Contract Protocols Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3+.

### 15101010 Layer 0 (Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 0 blockchains. Layer 0 blockchains are technologies that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.

### 15101020 Layer 1 (Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 1. Layer 1 blockchains are technologies that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.

### 15101030 Layer 2 (Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 2. Layer 2 blockchains are technologies that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.

### 15101040 Layer 3+ (Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 3 and more. Layer 3 blockchains are technologies designed for customized functionalities.
