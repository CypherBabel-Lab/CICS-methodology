# Blockchain Infrastructure (Industry Group)

The Blockchain Infrastructure Industry Group contains companies, organizations, and projects involved in smart contract protocols, computing, storage, and network.



## Smart Contract Protocols (Industry)

The Smart Contract Protocols Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, and bridge.

### Layer 0 (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 0 blockchains.

> Layer 0 blockchains are technologies that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.

### Layer 1 (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 1 blockchains.

> Layer 1 blockchains are technologies that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.

### Layer 2 (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 2 blockchains.

> Layer 2 blockchains are technologies that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.

### Layer 3 (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 3 blockchains.

> Layer 3 blockchains are technolgoies that ......

### Bridge (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols and frameworks of blockchain bridges.

> Bridge connect two economically and technologically separate blockchains to enable interactions between them.





## Computing (Industry)

The Computing Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in computing protocols.

### Computing Protocols (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing general computing protocols and frameworks with decentralized CPU and GPU resources.





## Storage (Industry)

The Storage Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in storage protocols.

### Storage Protocols (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing storage protocols and frameworks with decentralized storage resources.





## Network (Industry)

The Network Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in network protocols.

### Network Protocols (Sub-Industry)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing network protocols and frameworks with decentralized network resources.
