# Blockchain Infrastructure (Industry Group)

The Blockchain Infrastructure Industry Group contains companies, organizations, and projects involved in smart contract protocols, computing, storage, and network.



## Smart Contract Protocols (Industry)

The Smart Contract Protocols Industry comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, and bridge.

### Layer 0 (Sub-industry)

Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that are classified as Layer 0 blockchains.

> Layer 0 blockchains are technologies that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.

### Layer 1 (Sub-industry)

Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that are classified as Layer 1 blockchains.

> Layer 1 blockchains are technologies that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.

### Layer 2 (Sub-industry)

Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that are classified as Layer 2 blockchains.

> Layer 2 blockchains are technologies that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.

### Layer 3 (Sub-industry)

Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that are classified as Layer 3 blockchains.

> Layer 3 blockchains are technolgoies that ......

### Bridge (Sub-industry)

Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols or frameworks of blockchain bridges.

> Bridge connect two economically and technologically separate blockchains to enable interactions between them.
