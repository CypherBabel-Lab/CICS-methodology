> Collateralized stablecoins are a type of stablecoin that are backed by a reserve of assets. The reserve is typically made up of another cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, or fiat currency, such as the US dollar. The value of the stablecoin is pegged to the value of the asset in the reserve, which helps to stabilize its price.

### 10102020 Algorithmic Stablecoins (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that issue, operate, and maintain stablecoins that keep their value through algorithmic adjustments.

> Algorithmic stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency that uses an algorithm to maintain its price stability. These stablecoins do not rely on traditional collateral, such as fiat currency, to maintain a stable price. Instead, the algorithm controls the supply of the stablecoin based on market demand, adjusting the supply to keep the price stable. This is achieved through the use of complex mathematical formulas and mechanisms, such as smart contracts and decentralized autonomous organizations. Algorithmic stablecoins are often used as a hedge against volatility in other cryptocurrencies or as a means of facilitating decentralized finance (DeFi) transactions.&#x20;

### 10102030 Hybrid Stablecoins (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that issue, operate, and maintain stablecoins that combine collateralized and algorithmic mechanisms to keep their value.
