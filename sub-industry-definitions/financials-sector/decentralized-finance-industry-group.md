# 1020 Decentralized Finance (Crypto Category)

The Decentralized Finance Crypto Category comprises companies, organizations, and projects involved in decentralized capital markets, decentralized finance infrastructure, decentralized derivatives, and decentralized financial services.



## 102010 Decentralized Capital Markets (Crypto Sub-category)

The Decentralized Capital Markets Crypto Sub-category contains companies, organizations, and projects engaged in decentralized exchange, decentralized asset exchange, and decentralized liquidity.

### 10201010 Decentralized Exchange (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that operate and maintain platforms for trading cryptocurrencies without a central authority. A decentralized exchange (DEX) is a type of cryptocurrency exchange that operates on a decentralized blockchain network, allowing users to trade cryptocurrencies in a peer-to-peer (P2P) manner without the need for intermediaries such as a central authority or third-party custodians. Unlike centralized exchanges, where users must deposit their funds on the exchange, DEXs allow users to retain control of their own private keys and trade directly from their personal wallets. This provides users with greater security and privacy, as well as the ability to trade a wider variety of cryptocurrencies.

### 10201020 Decentralized Asset Exchange (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that operate and maintain platforms for trading digital assets, such as NFTs, on decentralized networks.

### 10201030 Decentralized Liquidity (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that operate decentralized platforms and services providing liquidity for cryptocurrency trading, such as liquidity pools and automated market makers (AMMs). In the crypto universe, liquidity refers to the ability of a cryptocurrency to be bought or sold quickly and easily without significantly affecting its price. A cryptocurrency with high liquidity means there are enough buyers and sellers willing to trade it, which results in a more efficient market where transactions can be completed at fair market prices. On the other hand, a cryptocurrency with low liquidity may have limited buyers and sellers, which can result in wider bid-ask spreads and higher price volatility.





## 102020 Decentralized Finance Infrastructure (Crypto Sub-category)

The Decentralized Financial Infrastructure Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in DeFi protocols and Non-custodial Wallets. &#x20;

### 10202010 DeFi Protocols (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that provide decentralized protocols that enable DeFi products and services. A decentralized protocol is a set of rules and procedures that govern a peer-to-peer network of nodes, where there is no central authority controlling the network.

### 10202020 Non-custodial Wallets (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that provide non-custodial wallets technologies, products, or services.  A non-custodial wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet where the user has complete control over their private keys and funds. In other words, the user is the sole custodian of their digital assets and is responsible for keeping their private keys safe. Non-custodial wallets are designed to give users full control over their funds without relying on a third-party custodian, which is a central point of failure and security risk.





## 102030 Decentralized Derivatives (Crypto Sub-category)

The Decentralized Derivatives Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in decentralized asset-backed assets, decentralized synthetic assets, and decentralized cross-chain assets.

### 10203010 Decentralized Asset-backed Assets (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that are involved in crypto assets derive their value from an underlying asset, such as cryptocurrencies, tokenized real estate, or commodities. Stablecoins are excluded from this class.

### 10203020 Decentralized Synthetic Assets (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that are involved in synthetic assets technologies, products, or services. A synthetic asset in the crypto universe refers to a type of digital asset whose value is derived from an underlying asset or a combination of assets, such as cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies, commodities, or other financial instruments. Synthetic assets are created and traded on decentralized platforms that use smart contracts and other blockchain-based technologies to provide users with exposure to the underlying assets without actually owning them. They are called "synthetic" because they are created synthetically through the use of complex financial engineering and derivatives, rather than being directly tied to the value of the underlying asset. Synthetic assets can be used for a variety of purposes, including hedging, speculation, and creating custom financial products.

### 10203030 Decentralized Cross-chain Assets (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that provide technologies, products, or services of cross-chain assets. A  cross-chain asset is created by locking up a native coin on its blockchain and issuing an equivalent amount of tokens on another blockchain.
