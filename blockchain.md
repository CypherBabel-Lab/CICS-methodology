# Blockchain - Sector(2)

The Blockchain Sector comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in blockchain infrastructure and blockchain services.

## Blockchain Infrastructure

The Blockchain Infrastructure Industry Group comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in smart contract protocol, computing infrastructure, storage infrastructure, and network infrastructure technologies.

### Smart Contract Protocols

The Smart Contract Protocols Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, and Bridges which are based on smart contract technologies.

* Layer 0: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.
* Layer 1: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.
* Layer 2: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on protocols or frameworks, or blockchains that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:red;">Layer 3: NEED MORE RESEARCH.</mark>
* Bridges: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on protocols or frameworks that connect two economically and technologically separate blockchains to enable interactions between them.

### Computing

The Computing Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in computing protocols.

* Computing Protocols: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on providing general computing protocols or frameworks with decentralized CPU and GPU resources.

### Storage

The Storage Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in storage protocols.

* Storage Protocols: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on providing storage protocols or frameworks with decentralized storage resources.

### Network

The Network Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in network protocols.

* Network Protocols: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on providing network protocols or frameworks with decentralized network resources.

## Diversified Blockchain Services

The Diversified Blockchain Services Industry Group comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in Blockchain Data Service and Blockchain As A Service industries.

### Blockchain Data Service

The Blockchain Data Service Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in Off-chain Data Services and On-chain Data Services.

* Off-chain Data Services: Companies, organizations, or projects engaged in providing technologies or services based on off-chain data.
* On-chain Data Services: Companies, organizations, or projects engaged in providing technologies or services based on on-chain data.

### Blockchain As A Service

The Blockchain As A Service Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in Blockchain As A Service field.

* Blockchain As A Service: Companies, organizations, or projects engaged in providing the creation, management, and maintenance services of blockchain infrastructure (mostly cloud-based).
