### Smart Contract Protocols

The Smart Contract Protocols Industry comprises companies, organizations, or projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, Layer 3, and Bridges which are based on smart contract technologies.

* Layer 0: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.
* Layer 1: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, or blockchains that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.
* Layer 2: Companies, organizations, or projects that focus on protocols or blockchains that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.&#x20;
* Layer 3:
* Bridges:
