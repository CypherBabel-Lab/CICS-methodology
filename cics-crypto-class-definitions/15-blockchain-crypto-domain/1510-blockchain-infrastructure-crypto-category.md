# 1510 Blockchain Infrastructure (Crypto Category)

The Blockchain Infrastructure Crypto Category contains companies, organizations, and projects involved in smart contract protocols, computing, storage, network, and privacy.



## 151010 Smart Contract Protocols (Crypto Sub-category)

The Smart Contract Protocols Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in Layer 0, Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3+.

### 15101010 Layer 0 (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 0 blockchains. Layer 0 blockchains are technologies that enable developers to build multiple blockchains that can be designed to each serve a specific purpose, tailed to their exact requirement while optimizing 1 or 2 dimensions of the scalability trilemma. Layer 0 allows cross-chain interoperability for the blockchains created on top of it.

### 15101020 Layer 1 (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 1. Layer 1 blockchains are technologies that validate and execute transactions without depending on external systems. Layer 1 is the base level of the blockchain infrastructure, and has its own consensus mechanism and native cryptocurrency.

### 15101030 Layer 2 (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 2. Layer 2 blockchains are technologies that solve different problems that arise in Layer 1. Layer 2 can also be defined as a scaling solution for Layer 1 and inherits security from it.

### 15101040 Layer 3+ (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on delivering protocols, frameworks, and blockchains that are classified as Layer 3 and more. Layer 3 blockchains are technologies designed for customized functionalities.





## 151020 Multi-chain (Crypto Sub-category)

The Multi-chain Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in multi-chain.

### 15102010 Multi-chain (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing technologies and platforms that enable communication, interaction, and asset transfer across multiple blockchain networks.





## 151030 Computing (Sub-category)

The Computing Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in computing protocols.

### 15103010 Computing Protocols (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing general computing protocols and frameworks with decentralized computing resources, such as CPUs and GPUs.





## 151040 Storage (Sub-category)

The Storage Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in storage protocols.

### 15104010 Storage Protocols (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing storage protocols and frameworks with decentralized storage resources, such as SSDs and HDDs.





## 151050 Network (Crypto Sub-category)

The Network Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in network protocols.

### 15105010 Network Protocols (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing network protocols and frameworks with decentralized network resources. A network resource, such as a wireless or wired connection, allows the connected devices to share resources, such as the internet, files, and printers, and communicate with each other. The network is usually managed by a router, which acts as a central hub to distribute the connection and manage the traffic between the connected devices.





## 151060 Privacy (Crypto Sub-category)

The Network Crypto Sub-category comprises companies, organizations, and projects engaged in privacy protocols.

### 15106010 Privacy Protocols (Crypto Class)

Companies, organizations, and projects that focus on providing technologies, products, or solutions built upon blockchains and designed to enhance privacy and anonymity in transactions and data management.
